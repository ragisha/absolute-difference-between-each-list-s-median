# absolute-difference-between-each-list-s-median
Given a list of integers nums, split it into two lists of equal size where the absolute difference between each list's median is as small as possible and return this difference.  Note: length of nums / 2 is guaranteed to be odd.  Constraints  n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
